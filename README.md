# Zongzi 粽子

Zongzi is a boilerplate workflow for Mixture.io with Autoprefixer!
Incorporated modules include structure from Sassaparrilla as well as an abstraction Foundation 4 (soon to be 5) mixin-based media quires and grid system.

Zongzi also contains ResponsiveSlides.js for a quick slide-show implementation.

Zongzi is not designed to be a tight and focused implementation that can be rapidly built upon and scaled. Stylesheets are `3kb` minified.
This is a work in progress that will continue to develop along with my competence in both CSS frameworks and preprocessing.

No guarantees here floks'
